# OSBot-Scripts
Multiple scripts I made for a bot for a game called Old School Runescape using the OSBot api

Most of these scripts got the account banned within a few days. 

The only ones that have not gotten an account banned are the ones in which I implemented a mouse recorder to do the actions which are:
-Mining
-High alch
-Theiving
-itemDropper

All the scripts were made in IntelliJ IDE and each one was compiled into a JAR file so the OSBot application could use the scripts.
